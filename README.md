DATABASE

Before you start anything, you will need to create a database with phpmyadmin and use laragon to link your database with your application

In the file groupomania/backend/ create a .env file where you put your access password to your database and your username if needed (root by default)
Then you'll need to create a base for your token (projet7 by default)
Also your localhost (localhost by default)

Make sure you installed Sequelize, if not you can use :

npm install -- save sequelize
npm install mysql2


FRONTEND

Open the file 'frontend' in your terminal and use this command

 'npm install'

then

 'npm start'


BACKEND

Open the file 'backend' in your terminal and use this command

 'npm install'

then

 'nodemon server'


IMPORTANT NOTE

We have some environment data, you can find a file named '.envexemple' in the backend file. Make sure to create a .env file.

Good job, your application is now working !
